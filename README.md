# PySh

PySh (Pronounced "Pish") is a Shell for Pythonista similar to that of StaSh.
It's just a simple little shell I made because I was bored. It's not meant to compete with StaSh, it's just a fun project I made.

## Installation

Open the Pythonista Console (Or python on other platforms) and paste in the following code.

```
import requests as rq; exec(rq.get("https://bit.ly/inst-pysh").content)
```

## Usage

> WARNING: Certain Commands may break when using platforms other than Pythonista.

Type the Help commands to see a list of commands. The titles are similar to that of Bash or CMD.
